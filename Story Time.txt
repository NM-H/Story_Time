Once upon a time there was a school in Tallinn where students went to learn how to make learning and serious games.

There were 2 paths students could choose to focus on before choosing their classes.

Many students in this program plan to graduate in 2 years and earn money doing what they love after the joy of graduation day.

The course is made up of a mix of foreign and Estonian students making almost all the classes a diverse and multicultural affair. 


2024-2026 will be the best DLG year group TLU has ever seen.
